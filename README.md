# Dice-Game(Link: https://vaibhavsolving.github.io/Dice-Game/)
A beginner-friendly web project that simulates a two-player dice game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every time the page is refreshed, two dice roll automatically — one for Player 1 and one for Player 2. Based on the outcome, the game displays which player wins or if it’s a draw.

This project demonstrates the use of:

JavaScript DOM manipulation

Random number generation

Dynamic image rendering

Simple UI styling with CSS

It’s a great starting point for those learning how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and how to build interactive browser games. Just clone the repo, open index.html, and refresh the page to play!
